# Shopify Tiered Pricing App

Welcome to the **Shopify Tiered Pricing** app! This app is designed to help you manage custom pricing for your clients directly from your Shopify Admin.

## Features
- **🛒 Client Login & Tier Pricing**: Each client has a secure login and sees their assigned pricing tier (Wholesale, Gold, etc.) dynamically.
- **Dynamic Pricing Control**: Admin controls tiers per company or individual; prices update across product, cart, and checkout pages.
- **Automated Onboarding**: 
    - **Existing Clients**: Login created upfront and credentials sent via email.
    - **New Clients**: Requests pricing via the app.
- **Shopify Native UI**: Elegant panel embedded in the Shopify Admin dashboard for seamless management.

## How it Works
1. **Admin Dashboard**: From the app panel, you can view your customers and assign them to specific pricing tiers.
2. **Pricing Tiers**: Define different tiers with either percentage or fixed-amount discounts.
3. **Automatic Discounts**: Once a customer is assigned a tier, the app automatically applies the discount when they are logged in.
4. **Email Notifications**: New clients receive their login details automatically via email.
